                        The different types of ransomware include crypto ransomware, locker ransomware, scareware,
                        leakware and Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS). Ransomware is a type of malware, also known as
                        malicious software, that prevents victims from accessing the data stored on their devices until
                        they’ve paid a cybercriminal a certain amount of money, commonly referred to as a ransom. </p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">Types of Ransomware</h2>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> <h3 >Crypto ransomware </h3>
                    Crypto ransomware is when cybercriminals use a program to encrypt the data stored on a victim’s
                    device. When the data becomes encrypted, it turns into ciphertext which makes the data
                    unreadable. The only way to decrypt the data is by obtaining the decryption key, which only the
                    cybercriminal has. The cybercriminal won’t provide the victim with the decryption key until
                    they’ve paid the ransom demanded.
<br/>
                    <h3> Locker ransomware</h3>

                    Locker ransomware is a type of ransomware that makes a victim’s device completely inoperable,
                    meaning they won’t be able to use it for anything. The only thing a victim will be able to do on
                    their device is pay the ransom which will be displayed on their screen. This type of ransomware
                    essentially locks you out of your device, hence the name “locker.”

                    <br/>

                    <h3>Scareware</h3>

                    Scareware is ransomware that displays a warning to users that their device has been infected
                    with a virus or malware. The warning then urges the victim to pay to have the virus or malware
                    removed from their device. Most of the time, the victim’s device isn’t actually infected, so
                    they’re being urged to pay to fix a problem they don’t really have.

                    <br/>

                    <h3> Leakware </h3>
                    Leakware, also known as doxware, is a type of ransomware that threatens to expose sensitive
                    information if the victim doesn’t pay the ransom. Because this type of ransomware threatens to
                    expose sensitive information, most victims panic and pay it to prevent their private data from
                    being exposed to the public.

                    <br>

                    <h3> Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) </h3>
                    Ransomware-as-a-Service is not exactly a type of ransomware, but more of a delivery model. RaaS
                    is when ransomware is distributed by the individual who created the ransomware and offers to
                    target an individual or organization with it for a price. RaaS is typically a subscription
                    service that cybercriminals pay for on the dark web.

                    If a ransomware attack executed through RaaS is successful and the victim pays the ransom, the
                    cybercriminal and the RaaS seller both gain money from the attack, based on their agreed-upon
                    terms. </p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How to be safe from Ransom ware?</h2>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4"> <h3> Regularly back up data </h3>
                    Ransomware takes advantage of the fact that most people don’t back up their data regularly. It’s important to regularly back up your data to prevent losing your data if something happens to your device that causes it to get ransomware.

                    Make sure to back up your data in encrypted cloud storage. That way, even if something goes wrong, you’ll still have access to your data. You also ensure that no one but you will be able to access your backed-up data since it’s secured behind encryption, meaning it can only be accessed with the encryption key, which is usually a username and password. Make sure that the cloud storage you choose uses zero-knowledge encryption. This is the most secure encryption available since it keeps your data encrypted at all times when you’re not accessing it.

                    <br>

                    <h3>  Be cautious of phishing and other social engineering scams </h3>
                    One of the most common ways for ransomware to infect your device is by falling for a phishing or other social engineering scam. According to Keeper Security’s 2021 Ransomware Impact Report, 42% of ransomware attacks were caused by phishing emails. Phishing is a cyber threat where the cybercriminal pretends to be someone the victim knows, or a company the victim has an account with, to trick them into revealing sensitive information or infect their devices with malware.  To carry out phishing attacks, cybercriminals send victims malicious links and attachments through email or text message and then urge the victims to click on them. Clicking on these links and attachments can infect a victim’s device with all types of malware, including ransomware.

                    <br>

                    <h3> Don’t click unsolicited links and attachments</h3>
                    As mentioned above, cybercriminals will often send victims unsolicited links and attachments and then urge them to click those links and attachments. However, clicking on a link or attachment you’re not sure is safe can lead to your device becoming infected with malware. Depending on the cybercriminal’s goal, the malware they choose to infect your device with may vary.

                    Never click on links or attachments that you’re not sure are safe and are sent to you unsolicitedly. If the sender urging you to click on a link or attachment claims to be from a company you have an account with, go to the company’s official website rather than clicking the link they’ve provided. If the sender claims to be someone you know, contact them through another method of communication to confirm they were the one who sent it. If they deny they’ve sent you the link, don’t click on it.

                    <br>

                    <h3>  Use a password manager </h3>
                    A password manager is a tool that helps you generate and securely store passwords for your online accounts. You must always use strong, unique passwords for online accounts because compromised passwords are another common cause of ransomware attacks. Keeper’s 2021 Ransomware Impact Report found that 21% of ransomware attacks were caused by compromised passwords.

                    Coming up with multiple strong passwords and remembering them all is impossible to do on your own, so it’s best to invest in a password manager that will help you create, manage and store them for you. Both individuals and organizations should use a password manager to prevent compromised passwords from leading to a successful ransomware attack..</p>

                    <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-4 mt-5">How ransomware gets installed </h2>

                    <p class="fs-5 mb-4">
                    <h3> Malicious email attachments and links </h3>
                    Ransomware attackers use phishing attempts to send large numbers of emails with malicious attachments or links to get victims to click on the attachments or links. Once the attachment or link is clicked, ransomware can be automatically downloaded on the device.

                    <br/>

                    <h3> Fraudulent advertising on websites </h3>
                    If you see something, such as a pop-up ad, appear on your screen while browsing the web, it’s important to carefully check its content. Your system may become infected by clicking on malicious advertisements, also known as malvertising.

                    Additionally, you may encounter situations where you are redirected to a suspicious URL, otherwise known as a website address, that has been spoofed to look legitimate and encourage you to download a file. These situations require special attention. Always inspect a URL before clicking on it to avoid falling victim to a ransomware attack.

                    <br>

                    <h3>  Downloading applications or software </h3>
                    Downloading applications or software from websites other than official ones is risky. There are many suspicious apps on spoofed websites, and if you click the download button, you’ll be downloading malware.

                    Always use caution when downloading an application. Only download apps from official app stores such as the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store.

                    < h3> Avoid connecting to public WiFi </h3>
                    Public WiFi comes with risks, one of them being the possibility of having your device become infected with malware. If a public WiFi network or a device already connected to the network is infected with ransomware or other types of malware, it can spread the infection to your device and any other devices connected to the same network.

                    <h3>  Access through remote desktop </h3>
                    If your organization’s remote desktop service has configuration issues or security weaknesses, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to gain access to your servers and deploy ransomware. If your remote access system is poorly secured, the possibility of a ransomware infection is even greater.</p>

                                If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be
                                private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it
                                has unquantified risks.
